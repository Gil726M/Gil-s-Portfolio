You will find two missions that required me to use my SQL skills in this folder. 

The file 'apply filters to SQL queries' contains a detailed list of tasks that required me to write varied SQL queries.
The file 'permissions in Linux' file contains a detailed task with many file permissions situations I had to deal with.
